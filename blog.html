            Question Four
        </p>
        <article>
         <p >The browser industry has really boomed in recent years. It is improving the user experience even more.
            There has been a big debate over using relative <br> CSS units or pixels. Sites are more responsive when their
            size is adjusted using relative units (%,em,rem). Browsers can handle zoom page for us, yet there is a difference
            between how the UI appears as well. Whenever we are using a responsive fonts,it means that the fonts are relative 
            to its parent conatainer. This imensely helps us to build mobile-friendly websites. Even though zooming can also help
            us the user interface( UI ) appearance will become destorted.

        Question Five
    </p>
    <article>
     <p>
         If the default browser is 16px, then the contents that are being shown are relative to this browser width. Whenever we make changes to the browser width
         the the contents that are displayed within the browser make a shift of width as well. A 200px element will be displayed with respect to its browser width 
         and also a 16px element will be displayed with repect to its browser width. So the interpretation will vary according to its browser width. It does not necessarily mean 
         that a default browser with 16px width can not handle a 200px element. The element will be displayed relative to its default browser width whatever it maybe.

       Question Six
    </p>
    <article>
     <p>CSS has gone under rapid improvement throughout the years. One of the biggest changes to the CSS3 by most experts can be creating a responsive interface for both window and mobile mode.
         We will be listing the top changes that defined the CSS3 below.
         <ul>
             <li>Additional selectors have been introduced other than CSS2. This makes styling different elements on a webpage pretty easy.</li><br>
             <li>Rounded corner elements are more easily addressed by using the border-radius property. This elements can spurce up a website.</li><br>
             <li>A box shadow has been added to create a drop shadow for an element.</li><br>
             <li>Text-shadow property allows different types of shadows to the text on a webpage.</li><br>
             <li>RGBA colors but now with opacity</li><br>
             <li>A property called transform enables rotating web elements on a webpage. N.B- it was previously done using javascript and additional plugins.</li><br>
             <li>A multicolumn layout is added to make variety of web designs.</li><br>
             <li>By using the new font-face property, you can include any type of font from a remote location and use it.</li><br>
        </ul>
        One of the major breakthrough as I have said before was making a website mobile-friendly as well. In order to achieve this we need to follow certain steps.
        Firstly, we need to focus on building just a non-responsive site by giving our attention to the what the site is needed for. This helps us to be creative. Secondly, we must add
        media queries to the site to make it responsive and mobile-friendly. Finally,although many developers ignore its importance it is advicable to use responsive fonts related to its parent container width.
